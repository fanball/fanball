I am studying Python, and I can publish my learning results in another repository. But I am a beginner, and I hope everyone can help me a lot. For example, I don't know how to write Readme.md. Can you teach me how to write Readme.md, or more ways to do it?

我在学Python，我可以将我的学成果发布在另一个仓库中。但我是一个新手，希望大家多多帮助我，比如我并不会写Readme.md，你们可以教我如何写Readme.md，或是它的更多方式吗？
