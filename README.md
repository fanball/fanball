I'm learning Python, and I can post my work in this repository (I don't know if I can). But I'm a newbie and I hope you can help me a lot, for example, I don't know how to write Readme.md, can you teach me how to write Readme.md, or more ways to write it?

我在学Python，我可以将我的学成果发布在此仓库中（不知道可不可以）。但我是一个新手，希望大家多多帮助我，比如我并不会写Readme.md，你们可以教我如何写Readme.md，或是它的更多方式吗？
